The difference between abstract and interface:
1. Even though a class can implement multiple interfaces, it can only extend a single abstract class
2. While interfaces can only contain abstract methods, abstract classes can have both concrete methods (with an implementation) and abstract method (without an implementation)
3. In constast to interfaces, abstract classes are allowed to have instance variables
